0,Jack Johnson,Better Together,https://music.bugs.co.kr/track/80099447,80099447.0,"There is no combination of words 
I could put on the back of a postcard 
And no song that I could sing,
but I can try for your heart 
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things 
Like a shoebox of photographs
with sepia tone loving 

Love is the answer 
At least for most of the questions in my heart 
Why are we here and where do we go
And how come it's so hard
It's not always easy 
and sometimes life can be deceiving 
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together  

Mmm, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together 
Well, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, it's always better when we're together 

And all of these moments just might find a way 
Into my dreams tonight 
But I know that they'll be gone 
when the morning light sings 
Or brings new things 
For tomorrow night you see 
That they'll be gone too,
too many things I have to do 

But if all of these dreams might find 
Their way into my day to day scene 
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between 
With only two, just me and you, 
not so many things we got to do 
Or places we got to be, 
we'll sit beneath the mango tree now  

Yeah, it's always better when we're together 
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together 
Well, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, it's always better when we're together 

I believe in memories, 
They look so, so pretty when I sleep 
And when I wake up, 
you look so pretty sleeping next to me 
But there is not enough time 
And there is no, no song I could sing 
And there is no combination of words I could say 

But I will still tell you one thing

But the absence of the light is a necessary part.

You can always come back home""

You can always come back 

Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that the home’s inside of you

No you’re never alone, you always get back home

Because they light up
the emptiness around me
Nothing can hurt as bad as human beings
And so I'm best friends with these
I got the brand new Nikes on my motorbike
I take it up to ninety just to feel alive
I'll keep on riding ‘till reality is out of sight
Ninety three ninety four ninety five
I bought a beach house
so I wouldn't fall apart
Made a significant investment
in a baseball card
Plastic and polyester filling up
my broken heart
Finally I'm a real superstar
I love material things
Because they light up
the emptiness around me
Nothing can hurt as bad as human beings
And so I'm best friends with these

from his spot on the shelf
He probly knows me
even better than I know myself
Lately he's really done wonders
for my mental health
Now I'll never need anyone else
I just want gold hoops gold rings
all my denim Japanese please
Jet skis and limousines
I just need these bare necessities
To replace the empty space you left in me
When you crushed all my hopes
and my dreams
I love material things

Excuse me I overheard once every life is great
It comes in different shape in different size
in different race
Is that why we are so often indifferent
I thought of this on back of my momma's car
Riffing how bad kids turn out to be
My momma stopped the wheels
and gave the stare
Re-cyphering old verses i wrote
That she thought were stale
This was back
when I used to curse on every verse
Handwriting 'em word for word
No sense of sinning at first
That shamelessness' overturned
I'm feeling like healing by killing my-old-self
Hinging like Ophelia or Lilith
I know it's silly but really
I barely cope and survive
If birds would crumble that pie
Thats what I sought to get by
Is it just life that I be circling?

Make sure the door doesn't hit me
On the way out
11 hour trip on a plane
Well that's a very long way for a day out
In a city full of suicide dreams
Movie stars and scenes
Plastic cemetries
Throw the stars on the floor
Walk the golden mile
Some drenched in camomile kisses
Broken bones and wishbone wishes
All you can eat take no a bow
No fomo no sleep
Can a woman teach me
How to be the man?
Tropicana and sand
All I ever wanted was a jam
All I never needed was a plan
Riding with models in the back of a cop car
Jumping the pool from the roof of a 5 star
And one day I could be
A distant memory
Setting fire to my house in the hills
Extinguish the flames
With some champagne and pills
If you let me I could be
Your dead celebrity
I don't wanna fade out
Sign my membership for the 27 club
Everyone around me wants a way out
When I'm struggling to cover my tracks
Should I be worried 'bout the scandal
Or the pay out? (Scandal or the pay out?)
When everything I own is on tick
And slipping through my grip
My classic ego trip
Go back to LC walk the golden mile
Some drenched in dry lip kisses
Some hits and some near misses oh well
We'll be dropping like flies
Gone in three nights
2016 it happens sometimes
Not everyone lives but everyone dies
Riding with models in the back of a cop car
Jumping the pool from the roof of a 5 star
And one day I could be
A distant memory
Setting fire to my house in the hills
Extinguish the flames
With some champagne and pills

I'm going down 'cause I was down for you
Lookin' like a clown for you
Surround sound speakers shook the ground
While he was pounding you
And that's a lot to take in
I heard the noise through the door
I had to break in
Shock up on your faces
Both of you were naked
Multiple occasions
Y'all were getting busy
While I'm busy at my day shift
You kept the brief cases
Situation tasteless
Even hooked up with a dude
While you were jamming to my playlist
Wow hey Alexa I'ma off 'em
Or maybe run away
Because I'm sick of all the problems
Going down and I can't even see the bottom
But I promise I'ma find it once

I'll be falling for a long time
Eyes so innocent
I didn't know you had a bad side
Yeah it's kinda weird
These emotions all attacking me
I don't want the answer
But how long this been happening?
Deep down see the sea ground
I'm getting close
I don't wanna sit and whine
We already toast
I love this show
But I won't see the second season
It won't be the same
With my favorite person leaving
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down like the Titanic
Eyes blue like the Atlantic
And I'm going down go going down
And so the story goes
Love grows and then it gets cut down
Then crumbles like a rose
And decomposes in the ground
It's tragic I suppose
Like dominoes how it goes down
The teardrops on the clothes
The beer knocked all over the ground
But fear not there's no fear my dear
'Cause here it all works out
The clothes will dry the tears will disappear
And from the ground
A rose will rise
And from the skies the sun will
Break the clouds
A rose will rise
And blue skies will surround

Through the depths of my own despair
I look up to the sky and I find my peace
I know you'll be there so
Starlight won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat keep me afloat
If I ever drift away would you be there?

Oh I just need you next to me

You never walk out

You're finally free
And you can stay up there
Right next to me
All this gravity
Will try to pull you down

And fan the flames so hot

And she’ll never flaunt around an empty purse

Just to stay a couple nights
In the silence she will stay the rest of her life

Journey:Don''t Stop BelievingJust a small town girl
Livin'' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Paying anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Don''t stop believin''
Hold on to that feelin''
Streetlight people
Woah
Don''t stop believin''
Hold on

Ohhhhhh

Hold on to that feelin''

My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.

He said, ""Son when you grow up,
would you be the savior of the broken, 
the beaten and the damned?""
He said ""Will you defeat them,
your demons, and all the non-believers, 
the plans that they have made?""
""Because one day I'll leave you,
A phantom to lead you in the summer,
To join The Black Parade.""

When I was a young boy,
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said, ""Son when you grow up,
would you be the savior of the broken, 
the beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.
And other times I feel like I should go.
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets.
And when you're gone we want you all to know.

We'll carry on,
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it.

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all.
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears
Ooh oh ohhhh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I! don't! care!

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)

Whatever this is I want it
Is it the way that its making me feel
Telling no lies cause I know that its real
Ooh baby
Whatever this is I want it
Whatever this is I want it

(Fall in love, fall in love
Too many times I
Fall in love, fall in love
Too many times I
Fall in love, fall in love
Too many times I, too many times I, too many times I)

Say you're lonely and I'll come right out, baby
Be right there for you I know you need saving
I don't care if you don't need no one else
Wont leave you waiting

Six feet deep now I need some readjusting
(Said I can't take it for you I'll break it)
Love you need, I'm the only one you trusting
(Wont you say it like you mean it)

I'm on a wave I don't feel any pressure
I never wanna feel like this when we're together

I just wanna love you like I'm losing all my days
But whatever this is I want it
Whatever this is I want it
Is it the way that its making me feel
Telling no lies cause I know that its real

Didn't notice that my motives
Were in vices in bad places

Now when I see you tonight
You’ll take one look and see it in my eyes
Oh, I can’t hide
How I’m not happy to be
Here in your company
You suck the life right out of me


And I say ‘Oh, well!’
As I’m ringing the doorbell
I guess I should’ve known better
Now I’m asking “Can you please….”

Even forever, I wanna go home
‘Cause honestly, you’re no good for me
Just give me a minute, or maybe an hour
Or even forеver, I wanna go home
‘Cause honеstly, when I’m with you
Think I’m better, think I’m better off a-alone
A-a-alone, a-a-alone, a-alone, alone

Fast life
I would’ve gave you the keys
Driving from the backseat
But you’d crash the car 
and then you’d abandon me
So I cancel our plans
Work on my gravity
I don't got time, no time to talk about it
To tell you ‘bout it, I'm sorry ‘bout it

Just give me a minute, or maybe an hour
But even forever, I wanna go home
‘Cause honestly, you’re no good for me
Just give me a minute, or maybe an hour

Starting things not really like me
Got a boyfriend says he likes me
Guess I like him but it's funny
Cause I'm not big on relationships
I'm more down for the flirt
All my friends say it's a problem
Nah, I just rather not get hurt

'Cause I can't take my feelings and
I can't trust my heart
So I never take my chances
'Cause I know I'll break apart
Buh-duh-duh-duh, buh-duh-duh
I hate the mushy shit, and
Buh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
I tell it how it is, and
Boom, buh-duh-duh, duh-duh
I wish that I was kiddin'
But I'm not good at listening
So I don't want someone missin' me
I'm so unpredictable, onе day, I'm irresistible
The nеxt, I hate myself
Never good for someone else
So I try to stay away
Don't want them dealing with my brain
But suddenly he's got me folding
'Cause I only want him to hold me, yuck but
I can't take my feelings and
I can't trust my heart
So I never take my chances

it was a mistake
Don't text me when you're drunk

I wanna go back, back, back but


She is my guiding star, she's on my tarot cards
She wants to break up, why don't you say?
That you dug your own grave
But I'm wondering if you want love anymore
I wanna go back but


That's life, why would it change it now?
One minute I'm up, one minute I'm face down
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back but

You think too much, shut up and hold me
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back but


Now she won't want me back like this, no
Now that I have gone and messed up
She wants to break up, why don't you stay?
I've been grinding my teeth so long, long, long
Won't be able to smile when you're gone
 (Gone, gone, gone)


You're my baby girl
Only one, for me
And when the walls are closing in
You turn and say to me
You wanna go back but... (One, two)

Moving like a judas

Nothing will change until it drains

Blaming the bait trees
Telling me you hate these g's

Because they ain't me uh they ain't me
Don't need to know

In the capital city
In a Catholic country
Got my back on the carpet
And my feet to the ceiling
To get the blood flowing
To numb the pain I'm feeling

The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you

The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you

To a wintery garden
Past a forest of conscience
On a curvy road
With every hour of passing
I started to believe in
The bubble I've been dreaming
Had a floor on the ceiling

The more I know I
The more I know I want

To be with someone so precious
That it makes me anxious
To be there by the target
And know that I could miss it
I never felt so lonely
As when you came and saw me
And the following moment
Took your eyes off me

And the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest

Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision I'm automatic
Quarterback I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it pack it up I don't panic
Batter batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy

My enemy
Oh the misery

Swae Lee mister could have took your bitch quicker
Hottest niggas on the planet got the place lit up
Fly niggas got expensive taste sight and touch
I am not your nigga, you got me fucked up
Bought your bitch the bra to make her tits sit up
I only fit in with the niggas who's staying down
Money talks, you just poppin' off at the mouth
If I'm the topic, then the conversation heated
Rae Sremm gettin' booked up in every city

Splash her with cash, had to spaz on the waiter

Young wild niggas, livin' fast
Stashing money in a brown paper bag
We set the roof on fire, then we flood it out
We just threw the money up, we ain't even count it
Shake it like a seizure, buzzin' in my speeder
Girl I'm buzzin' off the gasoline it's fuckin' up my speech

But I hate this part

I drew up our plans on a chart
Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit
My character's strong but my head is loose

She hits like ecstasy
Comes up and bangs the sense out of me

The tarot cards say it's not so bad
And the blades rotate there's just no landing pad
And better have said it but darling you're the best
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps

I hate this feeling
But I love this part

And I clearly want to let it start
We'll build a water slide

Inevitable but don't know how bad
The smallest things will get to you
Hoping we won't be a thing of the past

Leave worries far away when you're here with me

Always been a lil' mathematician, lately,

Got me losin' count of these bags,

Hard times don't last,

I done sat with the mayor and politicians, 
I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, 
I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, 
but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, 
but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas 
so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, 
searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they name buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper 
when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

 Through 20/20 vision
 To keep my cool up
 Might just need a fridge in here
 So keep you keep it
 There's no worry 'bout the present
 Future tense presence we will living in
 President Benjamin's coming, dividends
 But it ain't mean a shit
 I give this shit away

I'll be there for you
When you're screaming
But they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too
But you gotta be there for me too

But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end
But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

I'll be there for you
When you're screaming
But they only hear you whisper

I'll be loud for you

Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down

Kiss me like it's all the same

I can feel you slipping away
Just promise that you'll wait right here for me

 I wonder if your friends have had to carry you home
 And stay for the night because they don't want to leave you alone

Moved way too quick but he fell for her eyes
Down by the coast in a bar that she liked
He asked if she'd want to be his wife
What if she said no what if she didn't feel?
What if her heart wasn't properly healed?
Would I be around here still singing these songs?
I guess there's always some good at
all the wrong
I'm scared to make
the same foolish mistakе
Let my heart control my brain
Fifteen years latеr
can't capture that light
Once it dies down it's quiet hard to revive
I guess some things don't work
the way that we'd like
It's nobody's fault
is love always outrun by time?
Learning that lesson like everyone else
Plans fall apart even when you mean well
Sometimes your intentions are hard to control
Sometimes obsessions swallow us whole
I'm scared to make
the same foolish mistake
Let my heart control my brain

Just trying to stay afloat
Can't keep my head up
When the water gets this rough
You know it's not the life I thought it was
Cruising past the pawn shop
Looking for a watch
It's like your shirt says
Be grateful what you got
But I can't see things the way that you do
Too much bad advice
Tell me what lifts you up
When love breaks down
Brings you back to life
Let's drop the pulse
Just keep it down low
Talk the night away
Tell me what lifts you up
When love breaks down
The sleazy lines and sequined suits
Who got paid for that?
First intermission
See you at the bar
Let someone take the empty seat
I'm out the back
Driving off the interstate
Eyes a little tired
Too wired to meditate
I've been awake since 5
Let's go hang with your 4 letter friends
Get some more bad advice
Tell me what lifts you up

Maybe we can make base camp on the sofa
I don't really wanna leave this paradise, no
Let a bottle of Ros? remote control us
Baby you and me can get lazy for the whole night

'Cause every time we touch, we touch in slow motion
We ain't got to rush, got nowhere to go
Swimming in your love as deep as the ocean
You're luxurious straight down to the bone

You don't need nothing but a t-shirt
So put your dress right back in reverse
Italian Vogue should do a feature of you right now

You don't need nothin' but a t-shirt, no

You ain't really gotta get dressed up to be gorgeous
Oh baby, you can make Coco Chanel cry, oh
You are the queen of casual and you know it
Baby, you and me can take it easy for the whole night

Sometimes you gotta take a chance while it's there
I don't wanna spend my whole life hoping
So tell me baby, are we going somewhere?

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

[Chorus]
Or are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are? Just
Stuck at the start, we're
Watching them go back
Waiting for our right
Wondering if we're gonna be alright

[Post-Chorus]
Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are?
Just waving at cars


[Verse 2]
We could spend the night going round in circles
Talking about all the fears we share
Or we could just go get those windows open
And you and I could finally go somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

Wake up for a girl who never loved me
Thinking that she feels something, but it's hopeless
Counting down the months before this one leaves
'Cause baby only leads me on, every night
Got me holding open crooked doors, faded lines
Rules she makes for me to please her soul
But she'll leave whenever she fucking likes


So I've been drinking coffee in the morning just to wake up
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause caffeine thanks my mind and keeps me breathing
Through her fake love (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can't be in the right, she burns me every time
Thought that I'd be patient, but I just can't take her spite
So I've been drinking coffee in the morning just to wake up
(Ooh, ooh)


I hold on to the love we used to share together
Tied in with the good times we both had
Now we're slowly fading I know, more now than ever
She could never take me back the way I am
And every night is miserable, I can't forget
All the memories I counted on when we made love
All the moments when she held me close
Now I know I'll never see that girl again



So I've been drinking coffee in the morning just to wake up

Vivienne Westwood chain
Swinging like my mood
Sit around and watch cartoons
In the crib, sipping tea
Bad ******* on Zoom

I don’t care that I’m alone, I just wanna die happy
Make a couple M’s, invest it back and make it last me
I wanna see my friends and I don’t wanna be depressed

Sick of reminiscing, wanna put it all past me

And a bad little model, she don’t need no title
When I’m smokin’ on gas, so is everyone around
And man the checks keep comin’ 
so my hands keep countin’ like, “D**n”
Pour me somethin’, I don’t pass out
Keep on puffin’, man, that Kush he keep on stuffin’
Every day we get high
I ain’t makin’ no plans,

Chose the greatest day to come to LA
Make sure the door doesn't hit me
On the way out
11 hour trip on a plane
Well that's a very long way for a day out
In a city full of suicide dreams
Movie stars and scenes
Plastic cemetries
Throw the stars on the floor
Walk the golden mile
Some drenched in camomile kisses
Broken bones and wishbone wishes
All you can eat take no a bow
No fomo no sleep
Can a woman teach me
How to be the man?
Tropicana and sand
All I ever wanted was a jam
All I never needed was a plan
Riding with models in the back of a cop car
Jumping the pool from the roof of a 5 star
And one day I could be
A distant memory
Setting fire to my house in the hills
Extinguish the flames
With some champagne and pills
If you let me I could be
Your dead celebrity
I don't wanna fade out
Sign my membership for the 27 club
Everyone around me wants a way out
When I'm struggling to cover my tracks
Should I be worried 'bout the scandal
Or the pay out? (Scandal or the pay out?)
When everything I own is on tick
And slipping through my grip
My classic ego trip
Go back to LC walk the golden mile
Some drenched in dry lip kisses
Some hits and some near misses oh well
We'll be dropping like flies
Gone in three nights
2016 it happens sometimes
Not everyone lives but everyone dies
Riding with models in the back of a cop car
Jumping the pool from the roof of a 5 star

 Pray for better days, now it's 300k when my day ends
 Do you remember last night 'cause I blacked out?
 In that all white dress with her back out
 Said, be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile
 And thinking 'bout her past make her lash out
 See with me it ain't no worries at all
 Any problem I'll be there, one call
 If we locked in, you my dawg
 Fan of you, hang pictures on my wall
 Roll one, let's get high tonight
 Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
 Chilling with the stars like a satellite
 AP on my arm and it's shining bright

Okay okay
끝물 같아 보인다면?
내 공연와서 파도 타고
다시 떠들어 그리고 돈 내 돈 내
홍대병 예방엔 내 노래가 직방
어린이 어르신까지 싸그리 다 힙합
가수들 박자 대신 발매일 밀당

난 빛을 봤지 고글 쓴 후부터
넌 어두워 앞이 고글 쓴 후부터
충격적 사실은 어느 쪽도 해당 안 되는

Yo 장식장에 쥬얼리 빼고 트로피를 깔아
후광이 나면 다이아 따위 있으나 마나
비록 뒤로 밀린 적 있지만
위기를 딛고 다시 원위치보다 위로
기어이 기록 세우시고 기세등등
자신한테 건 기대에 부흥 중
부족한 부분은 수면과 비타민 D
주변인들 내게 권해 휴식
쉬어 갈까 하다 갑자기 랩 마려워

You should be more motivated
난해한 패션 가공된 목소리
누구나 쓸법한 돈 얘기
아무런 자극도 못 느껴

계속 타이틀 유지하면서 꿀 빨아
난 가장 화제성 있는 두 글자야
살짝 방심한 건 너가 무능한 탓
빡칠 수밖에 바드득 바드득
이를 가는 모습에 꺄르륵 꺄르륵
새끼들 연초에 쓸어버릴 계획하더니
이제 와서 하는 둥 마는 둥
Why don't you do it
Why don't you quit
사람 말귀 좀 알아듣길
굳이 날갯짓 왜 해 새 될 게
뻔할 텐데 그래 안 그래?

이젠 대한민국의 Main deux
나보다 바쁜 내 매니져 폰엔 100통의 부재중
브랜드 평판 섭외 1순위
말 안 해도 대세인증
너의 두 눈이 확인했잖아 
내가 나온 순간 다 게임 끝

고1 때 꿈꿨던 일들이 지금은 일상
방금 마치고 왔어 대기업 회장님과의 식사
상상했던 것이 딱 맞아 떨어지는 내 눈앞의 삶
내 이름으로 만드는 돈 어딜 가던 내 직장

오늘 뜬 인터넷 기사 제목은 비와이 열풍
끝인 줄 알았더니 이제부터 시작 
니 쉐키들은 전부 열폭
내가 인기 땜에 잘됐대 그 인기는 어디서 왔지?
아마도 얼굴인듯해 이게 말이 되는 것 같니

내 성공을 연구하는 분이 늘어나
기도가 이뤄지는 느낌 어때 울엄마
새로운 흐름을 만들어가 선구자적인 superstar

비와이가 되고픈 애들은 물론 매니져 사칭도 생겨
피곤해도 감사한 삶이 아닐 수가 없어 할렐루야

All right 그린 대로 이뤄지는 life
이 밤을 새우기만 하면 all night
All right 어제 원했던 건 이제 mine
더 많이 원해 더 더 더 I’m young n wild

오늘 되고 싶지만 니 애인이 그럼 니 친구는 개 삐져
When I say I'm the best mofucka
니 여자친구도 믿어
이제 센 척 안 해 그건 유치해
잼잼이는 넘나 귀여

JM man (you know) $exy $treet도 이젠 알지
비와이 말 잘 들어 먼저 감사 하나님
난 회개해야해 알지 Good night man every night
놈팽이 내 payday엔 drink 지갑 잃어버릴 때까지

맨 위에 위로 eir city 매일 다녀
damn it 이제 외국인 숙녀들과도 hallo
매 촬영 타투 위에 붙여 테이프
어제 하나 더 했어 이태원 berith
 
내가 여유 부리는 게 재수없대 좀 심했다면
lady들께만 구해 용서를
명예와 여자 plus big money 내가 생각하는 대로 
너무 잘 맞아 떨어져 like a puzzle

목요일 밤 난 내일 기다려
올라가지 내 team하고
멈춰 서는 건 구린 거래 
근데 오늘 밤은 좋아 이대로
  
내가 되고 싶은 사람 살고 싶은 대로 사는 사람
난 내가 살고 싶은 대로 
살면서 될 거야 내가 되고 싶은 사람

나를 매번 속이며 내 안엔
원하지도 않던 헛된 바램이

I apologize to myself I'm sorry

왜냐면 내가 중심에 굳건히 있잖아
주인공인마냥 굴어 주인공이니깐
넌 왜 아니라고 생각해?
너도 마찬가지란 말이야
이미 가졌다고 생각하고 움직여봐
믿음은 바라는 것의 실상이고
안 뵈는 것의 증거니까
니 머리 아닌 영혼이 가는 대로 가
기대하고 기다리는 자에게
비가 내리는 법이야
축복은 내가 벌린 입만큼
들어오는 거니까

뜨거운 음식도 무서운 영화도
이제는 좋아해
낯선 사람과도 잘 어울리고
친구들도 내가 좋아 보인대
나도 그런가 봐 옛 생각이나
조금 먹먹할 뿐야
자꾸 생각이나 Day by day 그땐
특별한 순간인 걸 몰랐나 봐
뜨거운 눈물도 서러운 일들도
이제는 그리워
하나부터 열까지 사라지고
희미해져 가는 옛 추억인데
자꾸 기억이 나서 네 생각이나

아침엔 잊혀지는 꿈만큼 자꾸자꾸 잊혀져 갈 순간들

특별했던 한 사람 혹은 한 사랑일 수 있다면
메마른 사막 어딘가에 지친 걸음

두 발 딛고 있는 이 곳에 나 지금 머무르는 이 곳에 
잠시 찾아 드는 편안이 또 익숙해져
조금 더 있고 싶은 유혹이 나를 주저 앉혀도 
(다 왔잖아 다 왔잖아) 눈앞에 길은 멀어 보여도

가끔은 지친 절름발이 바람에 닳은 걸음걸이

Farewell ooh








새까만 밤하늘을 수놓은 별빛마저








불어오는 바람 따라 가고








보고픈 그대 생각 짙어져 가는








시월의 아름다운 이 밤에








수많은 바람 불어온대도








날려 보내진 않을래








잊혀질까 두려워 곁을 맴도는








시월의 아름다운 이 밤을 기억해 주세요

마지막에 널 (마지막에 널)
안아줬다면 어땠을까 어땠을까
나의 옛사랑 옛사람
가끔 난 너의 안부를 속으로 묻는다
그리고는 혼자 씩 웃는다
희미해진 그때의 기억을 빈 잔에 붓는다
잔이 차고 넘친다
기억을 마신다 그 기억은 쓰지만 맛있다
그 시절 우리의 도수는
거의 웬만한 독주보다 높았어
보고 또 봐도 보고팠어
사랑을 해도 해도 서로에게 고팠어 목말랐어
참 우리 좋았었는데 헤어질 일이 없었는데
왜 그랬을까 그땐 사랑이 뭔지 몰라서
사랑이 사랑인줄 몰랐어

홀딱 잠 깨 창문을 닫지
우리는 마치 창 밖의 참새처럼
잠들기 싫어하는 애처럼 초등학생처럼
아무도 없는데 아무도 모르게
아무도 못 듣게 귓속에 말을 해 말을 해
그 시절 우리의 온도는
거의 저 밑에 적도 보다 높았어
성났어 감기도 아닌 것이 열났어
온몸의 어디든 귀를 갖다 대면은 맥박소리가
귓가에 그날의 너의 소리가
왜 그랬을까 그땐 사랑이 뭔지 몰라서
사랑이 사랑인 줄 몰랐어

어땠을까 (너와 나 지금까지 함께 했을까)
눈앞에서 살진 않지만 눈감으면 살고 있다
다른 사람 품 안에서 같은 추억 하면서 (어땠을까)
내 곁에 있진 않지만 내 몸이 기억하고 있다

그때 왜 그랬어?
구차해도 묻고 싶어
그때 난 뭐였어?

나나나나나나나나
나만 애탄 거니
나나나나나나나나
난 진심인데 넌

그랬구나 그랬어
좋았는데 넌 아니었나 봐
그랬구나 그때 넌
그런 줄 모르고 나 혼자 

이럴 거면 바래다주었던 그날 밤 
넌 나를 안아주지 말았어야지 
설렘에 밤잠 설치게 했던 그 말 
그 말도 말았어야지 그러지는 말지

비겁하게 숨어버린 너를 
돌아 올 거라고 믿은 내가 바보야
사랑스럽게 날 보던 네 눈빛에 
빠졌던 내가 바보지 
이럴 줄도 모르고 

이렇게 돼 버린 이상  
그냥 얘기할게
이미 떠나버린 니 맘 
돌릴 순 없으니

그랬구나 그랬어
좋았는데 넌 아니었나 봐
그랬구나 그때 넌
네 생각뿐인데 나 혼자 

이럴 거면 바래다주었던 그날 밤 
넌 나를 안아주지 말았어야지 
설렘에 밤잠 설치게 했던 그 말 
그 말도 말았어야지 이럴 줄은 몰랐어

RAP
어때 넌 어떻게 하고 싶니
지금 이 순간의 감정일지
중간에 금방 에러가 날것인지
I don’t know 하지만 내 생각엔
오래가진 못할 거 같아
너 아닌 나 때문에
이 관계는 이어지지 못해

잠 못 들어 아픈 이 새벽 
잘 지내니 문자 한번쯤은 해주지 
혹시나 하며 올린 우리 얘기에 
좋아요 누르지 말지 괜히 기대 하게

바래다주던 그 날 밤처럼
돌아와서 포근하게 나를 안아줘 
설렘에 밤잠 설치게 했던 말로
또 두근거리게 해줘 다시 날 녹여줘 

이럴 거면 귀엽다고 하지 말지 그러지 말지

잘 지내란 말이 무색해질 만큼
오랜 시간 함께해온 추억들이
한 장의 폴라로이드 사진처럼
가슴 한 켠에 남는다

미안해 잘못했어
용서해 란 말이 그리워질 만큼
너와 있던 시간이 항상 생각 나
항상 후회되고 그리워
어쩌다 너와 마주칠 땐
숨이 탁 막혀와

언제쯤이면 우리
따뜻한 인사와 함께
서로 웃으며 안부를 묻는
그런 사이가 될까
언제쯤이면 언제쯤이면
언제쯤이면 그럴 수 있을까

우리가 자주 걷던 그 거리를
혼자 서성이다 보면
소박하던 우리들의 추억들이
내게 인사를 건네는 것만 같아
울음이 목 끝에 걸려서
숨이 탁 막혀와

언제쯤이면 우리
따뜻한 인사와 함께
서로 웃으며 안부를 묻는
그런 사이가 될까
언제쯤이면 언제쯤이면 언제쯤이면 

외롭기만 하는 지금
그리고 행복 했었던 우리
언제쯤이면 네 앞에 서서
아무렇지 않은 척 웃음 보일까
언제쯤이면 인사와 함께
서로 눈이라도 맞추며
웃음 보이게 될까

막 서둘러 싼 짐과 여권뿐
방안은 미칠 것 같아서
거리는 측은해서
너를 제발 벗어나고만 싶어서

좁지 않아 정말 편한 걸
여권 지갑은 빼버렸어 너의 흔적이라서
흔한 남들 거랑 이제 다르지 않아
어쩜 우린 그렇게 다녔니
조심스레 열어본 그 속에선
여기저기 찍힌 추억들이
거리보다 가득해
니가 더 선명해서 마치 옆에 있는 듯해
못생긴 나의 사진 처량해
그 얼굴이 내게 원망하듯 묻잖아
왜 떠나보내야만 한 거니
너 정말 자신 있어
내 옆자릴 물끄러미 보네
오늘따라 많이 흔들려
그때마다 기대곤 했던
그 자린 풀린 벨트만이 덩그러니 반짝여
난 채워버렸어 누군가 있는 것처럼
